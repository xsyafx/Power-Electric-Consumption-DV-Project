**Problem Statement** 

Households often face rising electricity costs and inefficient energy consumption patterns, which contribute not only to higher expenses but also to increased carbon emissions. Nie et al. (2024) argue that residential electricity consumption accounts for a significant portion of national greenhouse gas emissions, with urban households generally consuming more electricity than rural households due to lifestyle and income differences. Without clear insights into usage behaviours such as peak consumption hours or the impact of electricity price reforms, it becomes challenging for households to identify wasteful practices and adopt smarter consumption strategies. Addressing these inefficiencies is vital to reduce costs for consumers, promote energy-saving behaviour, and support broader carbon neutrality goals. 

**Project Objectives**

1.	To analyze historical household electricity consumption data and detect key usage patterns. 
2.	To identify peak and off-peak consumption periods and highlight potential energy-saving opportunities. 
3.	To develop an interactive Streamlit dashboard that enables households to monitor energy usage and adopt smarter consumption practices. 
4.	To evaluate the effectiveness of identified patterns and dashboard recommendations in supporting household energy savings and emission reduction.
